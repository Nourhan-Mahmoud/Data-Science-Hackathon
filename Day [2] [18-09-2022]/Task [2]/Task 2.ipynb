       "'python (programming language)\\nfrom wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\npython is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[30]\\n\\npython is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. it supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. it is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31]\\n\\nguido van rossum began working on python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the abc programming language, and first released it in 1991 as python 0.9.0.[32] python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[33]\\n\\npython consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.[34][35][36][37]\\nhistory\\npython was conceived in the late 1980s[38] by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde & informatica (cwi) in the netherlands as a successor to abc programming language, which was inspired by setl,[39] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system.[10] its implementation began in december 1989.[40] van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 july 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as python\\'s \"benevolent dictator for life\", a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker.[41] in january 2019, active python core developers elected a five-member \"steering council\" to lead the project.[42][43]\\n\\npython 2.0 was released on 16 october 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for unicode.[44]\\n\\npython 3.0 was released on 3 december 2008. it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[45] many of its major features were backported to python 2.6.x[46] and 2.7.x version series. releases of python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of python 2 code to python 3.[47]\\n\\npython 2.7\\'s end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to python 3.[48][49] no more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[50][51] with python 2\\'s end-of-life, only python 3.6.x[52] and later are supported.\\n\\npython 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[53] as all versions of python (including 2.7[54]) had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution[55] and web cache poisoning.[56]\\n\\ndesign philosophy and features\\npython is a multi-paradigm programming language. object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[57] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[58] many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[59][60] and logic programming.[61]\\n\\npython uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[62] it also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\\n\\npython\\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition. it has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[63] the standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml.[64]\\n\\nthe language\\'s core philosophy is summarized in the document the zen of python (pep 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[65]\\n\\nbeautiful is better than ugly.\\nexplicit is better than implicit.\\nsimple is better than complex.\\ncomplex is better than complicated.\\nreadability counts.\\nrather than having all of its functionality built into its core, python was designed to be highly extensible (with modules). this compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. van rossum\\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with abc, which espoused the opposite approach.[38] it is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[66]\\n\\npython strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. in contrast to perl\\'s \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, python embraces a \"there should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it\" design philosophy.[65] alex martelli, a fellow at the python software foundation and python book author, writes that \"to describe something as \\'clever\\' is not considered a compliment in the python culture.\"[67]\\n\\npython\\'s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the cpython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[68] when speed is important, a python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c, or use pypy, a just-in-time compiler. cython is also available, which translates a python script into c and makes direct c-level api calls into the python interpreter.\\n\\npython\\'s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. this is reflected in its name—a tribute to the british comedy group monty python[69]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (a reference to a monty python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[70][71]\\n\\na common neologism in the python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. in contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[72][73]\\n\\nusers and admirers of python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as pythonistas.[74][75]\\n\\nsyntax and semantics\\nmain article: python syntax and semantics\\npython is meant to be an easily readable language. its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses english keywords where other languages use punctuation. unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. it has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal.[76]\\n\\nindentation\\nmain article: python syntax and semantics § indentation\\npython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. an increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[77] thus, the program\\'s visual structure accurately represents the program\\'s semantic structure.[78] this feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. the recommended indent size is four spaces.[79]\\n\\nstatements and control flow\\npython\\'s statements include (among others):\\n\\nthe assignment statement, using a single equals sign =.\\nthe if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).\\nthe for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.\\nthe while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.\\nthe try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.\\nthe raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.\\nthe class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.\\nيبلميبةملنةيمبنلةيمنبةلمنيب يبل ينمبةل يمبنةل 0يب . يبلمويلك\\nthe def statement, which defines a function or method.\\nthe with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (raii)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.[80]\\nthe break statement, exits from a loop.\\nthe continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item.\\nthe del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will cause an error. a deleted variable can be reassigned.\\nthe pass statement, which serves as a nop. it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.\\nthe assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply.\\nthe yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. this form is used to implement coroutines.\\nthe return statement, used to return a value from a function.\\nthe import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program.\\nthe assignment statement (=) operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object. variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. in python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. however, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. this is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically-typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type.\\n\\npython does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to guido van rossum, it never will.[81][82] however, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided, by extending python\\'s generators.[83] before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. from python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[84]\\n\\nexpressions\\nsome python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as c and java, while some are not:\\n\\naddition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. there are two types of divisions in python. they are floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division.[85] python also uses the ** operator for exponentiation.\\nfrom python 3.5, the new @ infix operator was introduced. it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication.[86][87]\\nfrom python 3.8, the syntax :=, called the \\'walrus operator\\' was introduced. it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.[88]\\nin python, == compares by value, versus java, which compares numerics by value[89] and objects by reference.[90] (value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) python\\'s is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). in python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b <= c.\\npython uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in java and c.\\npython has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression.[63]\\nanonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.\\nconditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y[91] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).\\npython makes a distinction between lists and tuples. lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in python). tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. the + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[92]\\npython features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. the statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.[93]\\npython has a \"string format\" operator %. this functions analogously to printf format strings in c, e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". in python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": blah = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f\\'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}\\'.[94]\\nstrings in python can be concatenated, by \"adding\" them (same operator as for adding integers and floats). e.g. \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. e.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\".\\npython has various kinds of string literals:\\nstrings delimited by single or double quote marks. unlike in unix shells, perl and perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. both kinds of string use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character. string interpolation became available in python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".[94]\\ntriple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, perl and ruby.\\nraw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and windows-style paths. compare \"@-quoting\" in c#.\\npython has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. the third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. slice indexes may be omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\\nin python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as common lisp, scheme, or ruby. this leads to duplicating some functionality. for example:\\n\\nlist comprehensions vs. for-loops\\nconditional expressions vs. if blocks\\nthe eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.\\nstatements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) c code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in python.\\n\\nmethods\\nmethods on objects are functions attached to the object\\'s class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for class.method(instance, argument). python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., c++, java, objective-c, or ruby).[95] apart from this, python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more.[96]\\n\\ntyping\\npython uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. despite being dynamically-typed, python is strongly-typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.\\n\\npython allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, spamclass() or eggsclass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\\n\\nbefore version 3.0, python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style.[97] the syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). in versions of python 2 from python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. old-style classes were eliminated in python 3.0.\\n\\nthe long-term plan is to support gradual typing[98] and from python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, cpython. an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile-time type checking.[99]\\n\\narithmetic operations\\npython has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4 % -3 == -2). it also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix‑multiplication operator @ .[103] these operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).\\n\\nthe division between integers produces floating-point results. the behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[104]\\n\\ncurrent python (i.e. since 3.0) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5/2 == 2.5.\\npython 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -3. the floor division // operator was introduced. so 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use python 3.0 rules for division (see next).\\npython 2.1 and earlier used c\\'s division behavior. the / operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -2.\\nin python terms, / is true division (or simply division), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division.[104]\\n\\nrounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. for instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. it also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. however, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[105]\\n\\npython provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. for tie-breaking, python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[106] versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.[107]\\n\\npython allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. for example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[108] c-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in c, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[109]\\n\\npython uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. the decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[110] the fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[111]\\n\\ndue to python\\'s extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library numpy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.[112][113]\\nprogramming examples\\nhello world program:\\n\\nprint(\\'hello, world!\\')\\nprogram to calculate the factorial of a positive integer:\\n\\nn = int(input(\\'type a number, and its factorial will be printed: \\'))\\n\\nif n < 0:\\n    raise valueerror(\\'you must enter a non-negative integer\\')\\n\\nfactorial = 1\\nfor i in range(2, n + 1):\\n    factorial *= i\\n\\nprint(factorial)\\nlibraries\\npython\\'s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,[114] provides tools suited to many tasks. for internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported. it includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,[115] manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\\n\\nsome parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the web server gateway interface (wsgi) implementation wsgiref follows pep 333[116]), but most modules are not. they are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. however, because most of the standard library is cross-platform python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.\\n\\nas of september 2021, the python package index (pypi), the official repository for third-party python software, contains over 329,000[117] packages with a wide range of functionality, including:\\n\\nautomation\\ndata analytics\\ndatabases\\ndocumentation\\ngraphical user interfaces\\nimage processing\\nmachine learning\\nmobile app\\nmultimedia\\ncomputer networking\\nscientific computing\\nsystem administration\\ntest frameworks\\ntext processing\\nweb frameworks\\nweb scraping\\ndevelopment environments\\nsee also: comparison of integrated development environments § python\\nmost python implementations (including cpython) include a read–eval–print loop (repl), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.\\n\\nother shells, including idle and ipython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting.\\n\\nas well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are web browser-based ides; sagemath (intended for developing science and math-related python programs); pythonanywhere, a browser-based ide and hosting environment; and canopy ide, a commercial python ide emphasizing scientific computing.[118]\\nنيوبملمينبل\\nimplementations\\nsee also: list of python software § python implementations\\nreference implementation\\ncpython is the reference implementation of python. it is written in c, meeting the c89 standard with several select c99 features (with later c versions out, it\\'s considered outdated;[119][120] cpython includes its own c extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older c versions, can e.g. be implemented with c11 or c++[121]).[122] it compiles python programs into an intermediate bytecode[123] which is then executed by its virtual machine.[124] cpython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of c and native python. it is available for many platforms, including windows (starting with python 3.9, the python installer deliberately fails to install on windows 7 and 8;[125][126] windows xp was supported until python 3.5) and most modern unix-like systems, including macos (and apple m1 macs, since python 3.9.1, with experimental installer) and unofficial support for e.g. vms.[127] platform portability was one of its earliest priorities,[128] during the python 1 and python 2 time-frame, even os/2 and solaris were supported;[129] support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms.\\n\\nother implementations\\npypy is a fast, compliant interpreter of python 2.7 and 3.6.[130] its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over cpython but several libraries written in c cannot be used with it.[131]\\nstackless python is a significant fork of cpython that implements microthreads; it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. pypy also has a stackless version.[132]\\nmicropython and circuitpython are python 3 variants optimized for microcontrollers, including lego mindstorms ev3.[133]\\npyston is a variant of the python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up the execution of python programs.[134]\\ncinder is a performance-oriented fork of cpython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time jit and an experimental bytecode compiler.[135]\\nunsupported implementations\\nother just-in-time python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:\\n\\ngoogle began a project named unladen swallow in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the python interpreter fivefold by using the llvm, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores,[136] while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock.\\npsyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler that integrates with cpython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. the emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard python code. psyco does not support python 2.7 or later.\\npys60 was a python 2 interpreter for series 60 mobile phones released by nokia in 2005. it implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the symbian operating system. the nokia n900 also supports python with gtk widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.[137]\\ncross-compilers to other languages\\nthere are several compilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted python, a restricted subset of python, or a language similar to python as the source language:\\n\\ncython compiles (a superset of) python 2.7 to c (while the resulting code is also usable with python 3 and also e.g. c++).\\nnuitka compiles python into c++.[138]\\npythran compiles a subset of python 3 to c++.[139][140][141]\\npyrex (latest release in 2010) and shed skin (latest release in 2013) compile to c and c++ respectively.\\ngoogle\\'s grumpy (latest release in 2017) transpiles python 2 to go.[142][143][144]\\nironpython (now abandoned by microsoft) allows running python 2.7 programs on the .net common language runtime.[145]\\njython compiles python 2.7 to java bytecode, allowing the use of the java libraries from a python program.[146]\\nmyhdl is a python-based hardware description language (hdl), that converts myhdl code to verilog or vhdl code.\\nnumba uses llvm to compile a subset of python to machine code.\\nbrython,[147] transcrypt[148][149] and pyjs (latest release in 2012) compile python to javascript.\\nrpython can be compiled to c, and is used to build the pypy interpreter of python.\\nperformance\\na performance comparison of various python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at euroscipy \\'13.[150] python\\'s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by the computer language benchmarks game.[151]\\n\\ndevelopment\\npython\\'s development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal (pep) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting python design decisions.[152] python coding style is covered in pep 8.[153] outstanding peps are reviewed and commented on by the python community and the steering council.[152]\\n\\nenhancement of the language corresponds with development of the cpython reference implementation. the mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language\\'s development. specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org.[154] development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running mercurial, until python moved to github in january 2017.[155]\\n\\ncpython\\'s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:\\n\\nbackward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. the first part of the version number is incremented. these releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.\\nmajor or \"feature\" releases, occurred about every 18 months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with python 3.9 are expected to happen once a year.[156][157] they are largely compatible but introduce new features. the second part of the version number is incremented. each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.[158]\\nbugfix releases,[159] which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. the third and final part of the version number is incremented.[159]\\nmany alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. python\\'s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development.[160]\\n\\nthe major academic conference on python is pycon. there are also special python mentoring programmes, such as pyladies.\\n\\npython 3.10 deprecates wstr (to be removed in python 3.12; meaning python extensions[161] need to be modified by then),[162] and also plans to add pattern matching to the language.[163]\\n\\napi documentation generators\\ntools that can generate documentation for python api include pydoc (available as part of standard library), sphinx, pdoc and its forks, doxygen and graphviz, among others.[164]\\n\\nnaming\\npython\\'s name is derived from the british comedy group monty python, whom python creator guido van rossum enjoyed while developing the language. monty python references appear frequently in python code and culture;[165] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar.[165][166] the official python documentation also contains various references to monty python routines.[167][168]\\n\\nthe prefix py- is used to show that something is related to python. examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame, a binding of sdl to python (commonly used to create games); pyqt and pygtk, which bind qt and gtk to python respectively; and pypy, a python implementation originally written in python.\\n\\npopularity\\nsince 2003, python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the tiobe programming community index where, as of february 2021, it is the third most popular language (behind java, and c).[169] it was selected programming language of the year (for \"the highest rise in ratings in a year\") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to do so four times[170]).[171]\\n\\nan empirical study found that scripting languages, such as python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as c and java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often \"better than java and not much worse than c or c++\".[172]\\n\\nlarge organizations that use python include wikipedia, google,[173] yahoo!,[174] cern,[175] nasa,[176] facebook,[177] amazon, instagram,[178] spotify[179] and some smaller entities like ilm[180] and ita.[181] the social news networking site reddit was written mostly in python.[182]\\n_________________________________________\\nstackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog\\nhere\\'s a collection of resources on how to get started using python.\\n\\ngetting started with… python\\nin this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the stack overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. up now, #3 on our list: python.\\n\\npython is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our developer survey. in 2020, 66.7% of respondents said they want to keep working with python. conceived in the late 80s, it’s one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers rust (2010) and typescript (2012)—evidence that original designer guido van rossum got a lot right.\\npython’s quirky name—in honor of the cult comedy show, monty python—belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. while it’s not primarily used for performance-intensive programming, it’s often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. this makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it’s used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to vfx and ai.\\n\\nsome  regard it as an ideal language for beginners: many terms are expressed using english words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages.\\nhistory of use\\ntrending tags on stackoverflow.com\\n\\nalthough python has been around since the 1.0 release in 1991, its usage has ballooned in recent years. indeed, as our former data scientist david robinson noted, since 2012, it has risen above the five other major languages (c++, php, java, javascript and c#) in usage as estimated by the number of stack overflow question views per month. tiobe’s 2021 index ranks python as third in popularity at 10.86%, rapidly gaining on c and java (16.34% and 11.29% respectively). today, 44 % of developers and technologists around the world are using python. \\n\\nuntil recently the language design and development was lead by a single person—dutch computer scientist guido van rossum, who stepped down as python’s “benevolent dictator for life” in 2018 but has remained an active contributor to this day.\\n\\nwho is using it?\\npython is more or less ubiquitous—it would be faster to list industries that don’t use it in some form. while it’s not the language of choice for consumer applications like 3d games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use python for tools and utilities. it is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes—for example, in the vfx field, nearly all of the major software packages (maya, 3ds max, houdini, cinema 4d, blender, and nuke) have embedded python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. it’s used more or less everywhere on earth and, well, even on mars.\\n\\nin fact, if you’re reading this on a mac, you already have python installed on your computer—just go to terminal, type ‘python’, and away you go…\\n\\nwho is it for?\\nstudents\\nthe use of short english keywords instead of symbols makes python particularly friendly for beginners. see the example below.\\n\\nadditionally, python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you’ll spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like c++.\\n\\nit comes bundled with a free ide (integrated development environment), idle, so you can get started quickly. in case you’re wondering, yes, idle is a reference to monty python’s eric idle—if you use python you’re going to be bombarded with references to vintage british comedy.\\n\\ndevelopers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed\\nwhile python typically runs slower than other common languages like c++ or java, it’s often much quicker to write—indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in python is three to five times shorter than its java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the c++ version.\\n\\nthis is one of the reasons it’s often used as a “support language”—software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. for the same reason, it’s also used for prototyping—code can be “hacked together” quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language.\\n\\ndevelopers working with text or numbers\\npython’s powerful string and list manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. and it’s a great tool for exploring data. \\n\\nthe fact that it doesn’t need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step-by-step, examining it at each stage.\\n\\npython’s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of ‘packages’, many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. these include the venerable numpy (mathematical functions and data analysis), scipy (for science), matplotlib (data visualization) and pandas (data analysis), and more recently tensorflow and keras (machine learning/ai), as well as tens of thousands of others.\\n\\nweb developers\\nanother key area of python use is backend development. it has built-in support for common protocols like html, xml, and json, and frameworks like django, flask, and bottle are used widely—for example, reddit’s backend is python. python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more.\\n\\nwhy you shouldn’t learn it\\nthere’s a lot to like about python, but it’s not always the perfect tool for the job.\\n\\nperhaps most importantly, python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like c++. while that means there’s no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. so you’re probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster 60fps first-person shooter in python, but it’s perfect for situations like data manipulation where you’re likely to spend more time writing the program than running it.\\n\\nadditionally, python’s somewhat unusual syntax means that—if it’s your first language—not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. for example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of english words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in java or c++.\\n\\nhowever, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity.\\n\\nkey concepts\\nthe core philosophies are summarized—in pythonic fashion—in “the zen of python.” these include:\\n\\n“readability counts\\nsimple is better than complex\\nthere should be

       "'python (programming language)from wikipedia, the free encyclopediapython is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[30]python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. it supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. it is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31]guido van rossum began working on python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the abc programming language, and first released it in 1991 as python 0.9.0.[32] python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[33]python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.[34][35][36][37]historypython was conceived in the late 1980s[38] by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde & informatica (cwi) in the netherlands as a successor to abc programming language, which was inspired by setl,[39] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system.[10] its implementation began in december 1989.[40] van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 july 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as python\\'s \"benevolent dictator for life\", a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker.[41] in january 2019, active python core developers elected a five-member \"steering council\" to lead the project.[42][43]python 2.0 was released on 16 october 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for unicode.[44]python 3.0 was released on 3 december 2008. it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[45] many of its major features were backported to python 2.6.x[46] and 2.7.x version series. releases of python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of python 2 code to python 3.[47]python 2.7\\'s end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to python 3.[48][49] no more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[50][51] with python 2\\'s end-of-life, only python 3.6.x[52] and later are supported.python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[53] as all versions of python (including 2.7[54]) had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution[55] and web cache poisoning.[56]design philosophy and featurespython is a multi-paradigm programming language. object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[57] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[58] many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[59][60] and logic programming.[61]python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[62] it also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.python\\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition. it has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[63] the standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml.[64]the language\\'s core philosophy is summarized in the document the zen of python (pep 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[65]beautiful is better than ugly.explicit is better than implicit.simple is better than complex.complex is better than complicated.readability counts.rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, python was designed to be highly extensible (with modules). this compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. van rossum\\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with abc, which espoused the opposite approach.[38] it is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[66]python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. in contrast to perl\\'s \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, python embraces a \"there should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it\" design philosophy.[65] alex martelli, a fellow at the python software foundation and python book author, writes that \"to describe something as \\'clever\\' is not considered a compliment in the python culture.\"[67]python\\'s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the cpython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[68] when speed is important, a python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c, or use pypy, a just-in-time compiler. cython is also available, which translates a python script into c and makes direct c-level api calls into the python interpreter.python\\'s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. this is reflected in its name—a tribute to the british comedy group monty python[69]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (a reference to a monty python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[70][71]a common neologism in the python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. in contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[72][73]users and admirers of python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as pythonistas.[74][75]syntax and semanticsmain article: python syntax and semanticspython is meant to be an easily readable language. its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses english keywords where other languages use punctuation. unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. it has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal.[76]indentationmain article: python syntax and semantics § indentationpython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. an increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[77] thus, the program\\'s visual structure accurately represents the program\\'s semantic structure.[78] this feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. the recommended indent size is four spaces.[79]statements and control flowpython\\'s statements include (among others):the assignment statement, using a single equals sign =.the if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).the for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.the while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.the try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.the raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.the class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.يبلميبةملنةيمبنلةيمنبةلمنيب يبل ينمبةل يمبنةل 0يب . يبلمويلكthe def statement, which defines a function or method.the with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (raii)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.[80]the break statement, exits from a loop.the continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item.the del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will cause an error. a deleted variable can be reassigned.the pass statement, which serves as a nop. it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.the assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply.the yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. this form is used to implement coroutines.the return statement, used to return a value from a function.the import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program.the assignment statement (=) operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object. variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. in python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. however, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. this is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically-typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type.python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to guido van rossum, it never will.[81][82] however, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided, by extending python\\'s generators.[83] before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. from python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[84]expressionssome python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as c and java, while some are not:addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. there are two types of divisions in python. they are floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division.[85] python also uses the ** operator for exponentiation.from python 3.5, the new @ infix operator was introduced. it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication.[86][87]from python 3.8, the syntax :=, called the \\'walrus operator\\' was introduced. it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.[88]in python, == compares by value, versus java, which compares numerics by value[89] and objects by reference.[90] (value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) python\\'s is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). in python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b <= c.python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in java and c.python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression.[63]anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y[91] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in python). tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. the + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[92]python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. the statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.[93]python has a \"string format\" operator %. this functions analogously to printf format strings in c, e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". in python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": blah = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f\\'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}\\'.[94]strings in python can be concatenated, by \"adding\" them (same operator as for adding integers and floats). e.g. \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. e.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\".python has various kinds of string literals:strings delimited by single or double quote marks. unlike in unix shells, perl and perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. both kinds of string use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character. string interpolation became available in python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".[94]triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, perl and ruby.raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and windows-style paths. compare \"@-quoting\" in c#.python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. the third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. slice indexes may be omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. each element of a slice is a shallow copy.in python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as common lisp, scheme, or ruby. this leads to duplicating some functionality. for example:list comprehensions vs. for-loopsconditional expressions vs. if blocksthe eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) c code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in python.methodsmethods on objects are functions attached to the object\\'s class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for class.method(instance, argument). python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., c++, java, objective-c, or ruby).[95] apart from this, python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more.[96]typingpython uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. despite being dynamically-typed, python is strongly-typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, spamclass() or eggsclass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.before version 3.0, python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style.[97] the syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). in versions of python 2 from python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. old-style classes were eliminated in python 3.0.the long-term plan is to support gradual typing[98] and from python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, cpython. an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile-time type checking.[99]arithmetic operationspython has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4 % -3 == -2). it also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix‑multiplication operator @ .[103] these operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).the division between integers produces floating-point results. the behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[104]current python (i.e. since 3.0) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5/2 == 2.5.python 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -3. the floor division // operator was introduced. so 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use python 3.0 rules for division (see next).python 2.1 and earlier used c\\'s division behavior. the / operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -2.in python terms, / is true division (or simply division), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division.[104]rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. for instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. it also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. however, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[105]python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. for tie-breaking, python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[106] versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.[107]python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. for example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[108] c-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in c, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[109]python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. the decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[110] the fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[111]due to python\\'s extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library numpy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.[112][113]programming exampleshello world program:print(\\'hello, world!\\')program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer:n = int(input(\\'type a number, and its factorial will be printed: \\'))if n < 0:    raise valueerror(\\'you must enter a non-negative integer\\')factorial = 1for i in range(2, n + 1):    factorial *= iprint(factorial)librariespython\\'s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,[114] provides tools suited to many tasks. for internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported. it includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,[115] manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the web server gateway interface (wsgi) implementation wsgiref follows pep 333[116]), but most modules are not. they are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. however, because most of the standard library is cross-platform python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.as of september 2021, the python package index (pypi), the official repository for third-party python software, contains over 329,000[117] packages with a wide range of functionality, including:automationdata analyticsdatabasesdocumentationgraphical user interfacesimage processingmachine learningmobile appmultimediacomputer networkingscientific computingsystem administrationtest frameworkstext processingweb frameworksweb scrapingdevelopment environmentssee also: comparison of integrated development environments § pythonmost python implementations (including cpython) include a read–eval–print loop (repl), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.other shells, including idle and ipython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting.as well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are web browser-based ides; sagemath (intended for developing science and math-related python programs); pythonanywhere, a browser-based ide and hosting environment; and canopy ide, a commercial python ide emphasizing scientific computing.[118]نيوبملمينبلimplementationssee also: list of python software § python implementationsreference implementationcpython is the reference implementation of python. it is written in c, meeting the c89 standard with several select c99 features (with later c versions out, it\\'s considered outdated;[119][120] cpython includes its own c extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older c versions, can e.g. be implemented with c11 or c++[121]).[122] it compiles python programs into an intermediate bytecode[123] which is then executed by its virtual machine.[124] cpython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of c and native python. it is available for many platforms, including windows (starting with python 3.9, the python installer deliberately fails to install on windows 7 and 8;[125][126] windows xp was supported until python 3.5) and most modern unix-like systems, including macos (and apple m1 macs, since python 3.9.1, with experimental installer) and unofficial support for e.g. vms.[127] platform portability was one of its earliest priorities,[128] during the python 1 and python 2 time-frame, even os/2 and solaris were supported;[129] support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms.other implementationspypy is a fast, compliant interpreter of python 2.7 and 3.6.[130] its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over cpython but several libraries written in c cannot be used with it.[131]stackless python is a significant fork of cpython that implements microthreads; it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. pypy also has a stackless version.[132]micropython and circuitpython are python 3 variants optimized for microcontrollers, including lego mindstorms ev3.[133]pyston is a variant of the python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up the execution of python programs.[134]cinder is a performance-oriented fork of cpython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time jit and an experimental bytecode compiler.[135]unsupported implementationsother just-in-time python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:google began a project named unladen swallow in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the python interpreter fivefold by using the llvm, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores,[136] while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock.psyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler that integrates with cpython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. the emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard python code. psyco does not support python 2.7 or later.pys60 was a python 2 interpreter for series 60 mobile phones released by nokia in 2005. it implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the symbian operating system. the nokia n900 also supports python with gtk widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.[137]cross-compilers to other languagesthere are several compilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted python, a restricted subset of python, or a language similar to python as the source language:cython compiles (a superset of) python 2.7 to c (while the resulting code is also usable with python 3 and also e.g. c++).nuitka compiles python into c++.[138]pythran compiles a subset of python 3 to c++.[139][140][141]pyrex (latest release in 2010) and shed skin (latest release in 2013) compile to c and c++ respectively.google\\'s grumpy (latest release in 2017) transpiles python 2 to go.[142][143][144]ironpython (now abandoned by microsoft) allows running python 2.7 programs on the .net common language runtime.[145]jython compiles python 2.7 to java bytecode, allowing the use of the java libraries from a python program.[146]myhdl is a python-based hardware description language (hdl), that converts myhdl code to verilog or vhdl code.numba uses llvm to compile a subset of python to machine code.brython,[147] transcrypt[148][149] and pyjs (latest release in 2012) compile python to javascript.rpython can be compiled to c, and is used to build the pypy interpreter of python.performancea performance comparison of various python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at euroscipy \\'13.[150] python\\'s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by the computer language benchmarks game.[151]developmentpython\\'s development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal (pep) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting python design decisions.[152] python coding style is covered in pep 8.[153] outstanding peps are reviewed and commented on by the python community and the steering council.[152]enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the cpython reference implementation. the mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language\\'s development. specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org.[154] development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running mercurial, until python moved to github in january 2017.[155]cpython\\'s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. the first part of the version number is incremented. these releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.major or \"feature\" releases, occurred about every 18 months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with python 3.9 are expected to happen once a year.[156][157] they are largely compatible but introduce new features. the second part of the version number is incremented. each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.[158]bugfix releases,[159] which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. the third and final part of the version number is incremented.[159]many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. python\\'s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development.[160]the major academic conference on python is pycon. there are also special python mentoring programmes, such as pyladies.python 3.10 deprecates wstr (to be removed in python 3.12; meaning python extensions[161] need to be modified by then),[162] and also plans to add pattern matching to the language.[163]api documentation generatorstools that can generate documentation for python api include pydoc (available as part of standard library), sphinx, pdoc and its forks, doxygen and graphviz, among others.[164]namingpython\\'s name is derived from the british comedy group monty python, whom python creator guido van rossum enjoyed while developing the language. monty python references appear frequently in python code and culture;[165] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar.[165][166] the official python documentation also contains various references to monty python routines.[167][168]the prefix py- is used to show that something is related to python. examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame, a binding of sdl to python (commonly used to create games); pyqt and pygtk, which bind qt and gtk to python respectively; and pypy, a python implementation originally written in python.popularitysince 2003, python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the tiobe programming community index where, as of february 2021, it is the third most popular language (behind java, and c).[169] it was selected programming language of the year (for \"the highest rise in ratings in a year\") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to do so four times[170]).[171]an empirical study found that scripting languages, such as python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as c and java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often \"better than java and not much worse than c or c++\".[172]large organizations that use python include wikipedia, google,[173] yahoo!,[174] cern,[175] nasa,[176] facebook,[177] amazon, instagram,[178] spotify[179] and some smaller entities like ilm[180] and ita.[181] the social news networking site reddit was written mostly in python.[182]_________________________________________stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow bloghere\\'s a collection of resources on how to get started using python.getting started with… pythonin this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the stack overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. up now, #3 on our list: python.python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our developer survey. in 2020, 66.7% of respondents said they want to keep working with python. conceived in the late 80s, it’s one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers rust (2010) and typescript (2012)—evidence that original designer guido van rossum got a lot right.python’s quirky name—in honor of the cult comedy show, monty python—belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. while it’s not primarily used for performance-intensive programming, it’s often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. this makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it’s used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to vfx and ai.some  regard it as an ideal language for beginners: many terms are expressed using english words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages.history of usetrending tags on stackoverflow.comalthough python has been around since the 1.0 release in 1991, its usage has ballooned in recent years. indeed, as our former data scientist david robinson noted, since 2012, it has risen above the five other major languages (c++, php, java, javascript and c#) in usage as estimated by the number of stack overflow question views per month. tiobe’s 2021 index ranks python as third in popularity at 10.86%, rapidly gaining on c and java (16.34% and 11.29% respectively). today, 44 % of developers and technologists around the world are using python. until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person—dutch computer scientist guido van rossum, who stepped down as python’s “benevolent dictator for life” in 2018 but has remained an active contributor to this day.who is using it?python is more or less ubiquitous—it would be faster to list industries that don’t use it in some form. while it’s not the language of choice for consumer applications like 3d games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use python for tools and utilities. it is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes—for example, in the vfx field, nearly all of the major software packages (maya, 3ds max, houdini, cinema 4d, blender, and nuke) have embedded python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. it’s used more or less everywhere on earth and, well, even on mars.in fact, if you’re reading this on a mac, you already have python installed on your computer—just go to terminal, type ‘python’, and away you go…who is it for?studentsthe use of short english keywords instead of symbols makes python particularly friendly for beginners. see the example below.additionally, python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you’ll spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like c++.it comes bundled with a free ide (integrated development environment), idle, so you can get started quickly. in case you’re wondering, yes, idle is a reference to monty python’s eric idle—if you use python you’re going to be bombarded with references to vintage british comedy.developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speedwhile python typically runs slower than other common languages like c++ or java, it’s often much quicker to write—indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in python is three to five times shorter than its java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the c++ version.this is one of the reasons it’s often used as a “support language”—software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. for the same reason, it’s also used for prototyping—code can be “hacked together” quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language.developers working with text or numberspython’s powerful string and list manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. and it’s a great tool for exploring data. the fact that it doesn’t need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step-by-step, examining it at each stage.python’s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of ‘packages’, many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. these include the venerable numpy (mathematical functions and data analysis), scipy (for science), matplotlib (data visualization) and pandas (data analysis), and more recently tensorflow and keras (machine learning/ai), as well as tens of thousands of others.web developersanother key area of python use is backend development. it has built-in support for common protocols like html, xml, and json, and frameworks like django, flask, and bottle are used widely—for example, reddit’s backend is python. python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more.why you shouldn’t learn itthere’s a lot to like about python, but it’s not always the perfect tool for the job.perhaps most importantly, python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like c++. while that means there’s no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. so you’re probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster 60fps first-person shooter in python, but it’s perfect for situations like data manipulation where you’re likely to spend more time writing the program than running it.additionally, python’s somewhat unusual syntax means that—if it’s your first language—not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. for example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of english words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in java or c++.however, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity.key conceptsthe core philosophies are summarized—in pythonic fashion—in “the zen of python.” these

       "'python (programming language)from wikipedia, the free encyclopediapython is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[30]python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. it supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. it is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31]guido van rossum began working on python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the abc programming language, and first released it in 1991 as python 0.9.0.[32] python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[33]python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.[34][35][36][37]historypython was conceived in the late 1980s[38] by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde & informatica (cwi) in the netherlands as a successor to abc programming language, which was inspired by setl,[39] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system.[10] its implementation began in december 1989.[40] van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 july 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as python\\'s \"benevolent dictator for life\", a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker.[41] in january 2019, active python core developers elected a five-member \"steering council\" to lead the project.[42][43]python 2.0 was released on 16 october 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for unicode.[44]python 3.0 was released on 3 december 2008. it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[45] many of its major features were backported to python 2.6.x[46] and 2.7.x version series. releases of python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of python 2 code to python 3.[47]python 2.7\\'s end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to python 3.[48][49] no more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[50][51] with python 2\\'s end-of-life, only python 3.6.x[52] and later are supported.python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[53] as all versions of python (including 2.7[54]) had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution[55] and web cache poisoning.[56]design philosophy and featurespython is a multi-paradigm programming language. object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[57] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[58] many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[59][60] and logic programming.[61]python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[62] it also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.python\\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition. it has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[63] the standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml.[64]the language\\'s core philosophy is summarized in the document the zen of python (pep 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[65]beautiful is better than ugly.explicit is better than implicit.simple is better than complex.complex is better than complicated.readability counts.rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, python was designed to be highly extensible (with modules). this compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. van rossum\\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with abc, which espoused the opposite approach.[38] it is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[66]python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. in contrast to perl\\'s \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, python embraces a \"there should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it\" design philosophy.[65] alex martelli, a fellow at the python software foundation and python book author, writes that \"to describe something as \\'clever\\' is not considered a compliment in the python culture.\"[67]python\\'s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the cpython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[68] when speed is important, a python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c, or use pypy, a just-in-time compiler. cython is also available, which translates a python script into c and makes direct c-level api calls into the python interpreter.python\\'s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. this is reflected in its name—a tribute to the british comedy group monty python[69]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (a reference to a monty python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[70][71]a common neologism in the python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. in contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[72][73]users and admirers of python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as pythonistas.[74][75]syntax and semanticsmain article: python syntax and semanticspython is meant to be an easily readable language. its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses english keywords where other languages use punctuation. unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. it has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal.[76]indentationmain article: python syntax and semantics § indentationpython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. an increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[77] thus, the program\\'s visual structure accurately represents the program\\'s semantic structure.[78] this feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. the recommended indent size is four spaces.[79]statements and control flowpython\\'s statements include (among others):the assignment statement, using a single equals sign =.the if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).the for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.the while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.the try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.the raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.the class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.يبلميبةملنةيمبنلةيمنبةلمنيب يبل ينمبةل يمبنةل 0يب . يبلمويلكthe def statement, which defines a function or method.the with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (raii)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.[80]the break statement, exits from a loop.the continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item.the del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will cause an error. a deleted variable can be reassigned.the pass statement, which serves as a nop. it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.the assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply.the yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. this form is used to implement coroutines.the return statement, used to return a value from a function.the import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program.the assignment statement (=) operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object. variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. in python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. however, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. this is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically-typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type.python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to guido van rossum, it never will.[81][82] however, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided, by extending python\\'s generators.[83] before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. from python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[84]expressionssome python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as c and java, while some are not:addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. there are two types of divisions in python. they are floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division.[85] python also uses the ** operator for exponentiation.from python 3.5, the new  infix operator was introduced. it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication.[86][87]from python 3.8, the syntax :=, called the \\'walrus operator\\' was introduced. it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.[88]in python, == compares by value, versus java, which compares numerics by value[89] and objects by reference.[90] (value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) python\\'s is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). in python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b <= c.python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in java and c.python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression.[63]anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y[91] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in python). tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. the + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[92]python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. the statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.[93]python has a \"string format\" operator %. this functions analogously to printf format strings in c, e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". in python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": blah = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f\\'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}\\'.[94]strings in python can be concatenated, by \"adding\" them (same operator as for adding integers and floats). e.g. \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. e.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\".python has various kinds of string literals:strings delimited by single or double quote marks. unlike in unix shells, perl and perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. both kinds of string use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character. string interpolation became available in python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".[94]triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, perl and ruby.raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and windows-style paths. compare \"-quoting\" in c#.python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. the third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. slice indexes may be omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. each element of a slice is a shallow copy.in python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as common lisp, scheme, or ruby. this leads to duplicating some functionality. for example:list comprehensions vs. for-loopsconditional expressions vs. if blocksthe eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) c code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in python.methodsmethods on objects are functions attached to the object\\'s class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for class.method(instance, argument). python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., c++, java, objective-c, or ruby).[95] apart from this, python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more.[96]typingpython uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. despite being dynamically-typed, python is strongly-typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, spamclass() or eggsclass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.before version 3.0, python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style.[97] the syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). in versions of python 2 from python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. old-style classes were eliminated in python 3.0.the long-term plan is to support gradual typing[98] and from python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, cpython. an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile-time type checking.[99]arithmetic operationspython has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4 % -3 == -2). it also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix‑multiplication operator  .[103] these operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).the division between integers produces floating-point results. the behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[104]current python (i.e. since 3.0) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5/2 == 2.5.python 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -3. the floor division // operator was introduced. so 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use python 3.0 rules for division (see next).python 2.1 and earlier used c\\'s division behavior. the / operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -2.in python terms, / is true division (or simply division), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division.[104]rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. for instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. it also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. however, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[105]python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. for tie-breaking, python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[106] versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.[107]python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. for example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[108] c-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in c, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[109]python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. the decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[110] the fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[111]due to python\\'s extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library numpy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.[112][113]programming exampleshello world program:print(\\'hello, world!\\')program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer:n = int(input(\\'type a number, and its factorial will be printed: \\'))if n < 0:    raise valueerror(\\'you must enter a non-negative integer\\')factorial = 1for i in range(2, n + 1):    factorial *= iprint(factorial)librariespython\\'s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,[114] provides tools suited to many tasks. for internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported. it includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,[115] manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the web server gateway interface (wsgi) implementation wsgiref follows pep 333[116]), but most modules are not. they are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. however, because most of the standard library is cross-platform python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.as of september 2021, the python package index (pypi), the official repository for third-party python software, contains over 329,000[117] packages with a wide range of functionality, including:automationdata analyticsdatabasesdocumentationgraphical user interfacesimage processingmachine learningmobile appmultimediacomputer networkingscientific computingsystem administrationtest frameworkstext processingweb frameworksweb scrapingdevelopment environmentssee also: comparison of integrated development environments § pythonmost python implementations (including cpython) include a read–eval–print loop (repl), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.other shells, including idle and ipython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting.as well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are web browser-based ides; sagemath (intended for developing science and math-related python programs); pythonanywhere, a browser-based ide and hosting environment; and canopy ide, a commercial python ide emphasizing scientific computing.[118]نيوبملمينبلimplementationssee also: list of python software § python implementationsreference implementationcpython is the reference implementation of python. it is written in c, meeting the c89 standard with several select c99 features (with later c versions out, it\\'s considered outdated;[119][120] cpython includes its own c extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older c versions, can e.g. be implemented with c11 or c++[121]).[122] it compiles python programs into an intermediate bytecode[123] which is then executed by its virtual machine.[124] cpython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of c and native python. it is available for many platforms, including windows (starting with python 3.9, the python installer deliberately fails to install on windows 7 and 8;[125][126] windows xp was supported until python 3.5) and most modern unix-like systems, including macos (and apple m1 macs, since python 3.9.1, with experimental installer) and unofficial support for e.g. vms.[127] platform portability was one of its earliest priorities,[128] during the python 1 and python 2 time-frame, even os/2 and solaris were supported;[129] support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms.other implementationspypy is a fast, compliant interpreter of python 2.7 and 3.6.[130] its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over cpython but several libraries written in c cannot be used with it.[131]stackless python is a significant fork of cpython that implements microthreads; it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. pypy also has a stackless version.[132]micropython and circuitpython are python 3 variants optimized for microcontrollers, including lego mindstorms ev3.[133]pyston is a variant of the python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up the execution of python programs.[134]cinder is a performance-oriented fork of cpython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time jit and an experimental bytecode compiler.[135]unsupported implementationsother just-in-time python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:google began a project named unladen swallow in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the python interpreter fivefold by using the llvm, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores,[136] while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock.psyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler that integrates with cpython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. the emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard python code. psyco does not support python 2.7 or later.pys60 was a python 2 interpreter for series 60 mobile phones released by nokia in 2005. it implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the symbian operating system. the nokia n900 also supports python with gtk widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.[137]cross-compilers to other languagesthere are several compilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted python, a restricted subset of python, or a language similar to python as the source language:cython compiles (a superset of) python 2.7 to c (while the resulting code is also usable with python 3 and also e.g. c++).nuitka compiles python into c++.[138]pythran compiles a subset of python 3 to c++.[139][140][141]pyrex (latest release in 2010) and shed skin (latest release in 2013) compile to c and c++ respectively.google\\'s grumpy (latest release in 2017) transpiles python 2 to go.[142][143][144]ironpython (now abandoned by microsoft) allows running python 2.7 programs on the .net common language runtime.[145]jython compiles python 2.7 to java bytecode, allowing the use of the java libraries from a python program.[146]myhdl is a python-based hardware description language (hdl), that converts myhdl code to verilog or vhdl code.numba uses llvm to compile a subset of python to machine code.brython,[147] transcrypt[148][149] and pyjs (latest release in 2012) compile python to javascript.rpython can be compiled to c, and is used to build the pypy interpreter of python.performancea performance comparison of various python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at euroscipy \\'13.[150] python\\'s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by the computer language benchmarks game.[151]developmentpython\\'s development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal (pep) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting python design decisions.[152] python coding style is covered in pep 8.[153] outstanding peps are reviewed and commented on by the python community and the steering council.[152]enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the cpython reference implementation. the mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language\\'s development. specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org.[154] development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running mercurial, until python moved to github in january 2017.[155]cpython\\'s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. the first part of the version number is incremented. these releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.major or \"feature\" releases, occurred about every 18 months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with python 3.9 are expected to happen once a year.[156][157] they are largely compatible but introduce new features. the second part of the version number is incremented. each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.[158]bugfix releases,[159] which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. the third and final part of the version number is incremented.[159]many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. python\\'s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development.[160]the major academic conference on python is pycon. there are also special python mentoring programmes, such as pyladies.python 3.10 deprecates wstr (to be removed in python 3.12; meaning python extensions[161] need to be modified by then),[162] and also plans to add pattern matching to the language.[163]api documentation generatorstools that can generate documentation for python api include pydoc (available as part of standard library), sphinx, pdoc and its forks, doxygen and graphviz, among others.[164]namingpython\\'s name is derived from the british comedy group monty python, whom python creator guido van rossum enjoyed while developing the language. monty python references appear frequently in python code and culture;[165] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar.[165][166] the official python documentation also contains various references to monty python routines.[167][168]the prefix py- is used to show that something is related to python. examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame, a binding of sdl to python (commonly used to create games); pyqt and pygtk, which bind qt and gtk to python respectively; and pypy, a python implementation originally written in python.popularitysince 2003, python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the tiobe programming community index where, as of february 2021, it is the third most popular language (behind java, and c).[169] it was selected programming language of the year (for \"the highest rise in ratings in a year\") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to do so four times[170]).[171]an empirical study found that scripting languages, such as python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as c and java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often \"better than java and not much worse than c or c++\".[172]large organizations that use python include wikipedia, google,[173] yahoo!,[174] cern,[175] nasa,[176] facebook,[177] amazon, instagram,[178] spotify[179] and some smaller entities like ilm[180] and ita.[181] the social news networking site reddit was written mostly in python.[182]_________________________________________stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow bloghere\\'s a collection of resources on how to get started using python.getting started with… pythonin this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the stack overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. up now, #3 on our list: python.python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our developer survey. in 2020, 66.7% of respondents said they want to keep working with python. conceived in the late 80s, it’s one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers rust (2010) and typescript (2012)—evidence that original designer guido van rossum got a lot right.python’s quirky name—in honor of the cult comedy show, monty python—belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. while it’s not primarily used for performance-intensive programming, it’s often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. this makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it’s used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to vfx and ai.some  regard it as an ideal language for beginners: many terms are expressed using english words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages.history of usetrending tags on stackoverflow.comalthough python has been around since the 1.0 release in 1991, its usage has ballooned in recent years. indeed, as our former data scientist david robinson noted, since 2012, it has risen above the five other major languages (c++, php, java, javascript and c#) in usage as estimated by the number of stack overflow question views per month. tiobe’s 2021 index ranks python as third in popularity at 10.86%, rapidly gaining on c and java (16.34% and 11.29% respectively). today, 44 % of developers and technologists around the world are using python. until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person—dutch computer scientist guido van rossum, who stepped down as python’s “benevolent dictator for life” in 2018 but has remained an active contributor to this day.who is using it?python is more or less ubiquitous—it would be faster to list industries that don’t use it in some form. while it’s not the language of choice for consumer applications like 3d games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use python for tools and utilities. it is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes—for example, in the vfx field, nearly all of the major software packages (maya, 3ds max, houdini, cinema 4d, blender, and nuke) have embedded python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. it’s used more or less everywhere on earth and, well, even on mars.in fact, if you’re reading this on a mac, you already have python installed on your computer—just go to terminal, type ‘python’, and away you go…who is it for?studentsthe use of short english keywords instead of symbols makes python particularly friendly for beginners. see the example below.additionally, python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you’ll spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like c++.it comes bundled with a free ide (integrated development environment), idle, so you can get started quickly. in case you’re wondering, yes, idle is a reference to monty python’s eric idle—if you use python you’re going to be bombarded with references to vintage british comedy.developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speedwhile python typically runs slower than other common languages like c++ or java, it’s often much quicker to write—indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in python is three to five times shorter than its java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the c++ version.this is one of the reasons it’s often used as a “support language”—software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. for the same reason, it’s also used for prototyping—code can be “hacked together” quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language.developers working with text or numberspython’s powerful string and list manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. and it’s a great tool for exploring data. the fact that it doesn’t need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step-by-step, examining it at each stage.python’s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of ‘packages’, many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. these include the venerable numpy (mathematical functions and data analysis), scipy (for science), matplotlib (data visualization) and pandas (data analysis), and more recently tensorflow and keras (machine learning/ai), as well as tens of thousands of others.web developersanother key area of python use is backend development. it has built-in support for common protocols like html, xml, and json, and frameworks like django, flask, and bottle are used widely—for example, reddit’s backend is python. python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more.why you shouldn’t learn itthere’s a lot to like about python, but it’s not always the perfect tool for the job.perhaps most importantly, python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like c++. while that means there’s no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. so you’re probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster 60fps first-person shooter in python, but it’s perfect for situations like data manipulation where you’re likely to spend more time writing the program than running it.additionally, python’s somewhat unusual syntax means that—if it’s your first language—not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. for example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of english words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in java or c++.however, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity.key conceptsthe core philosophies are summarized—in pythonic fashion—in “the zen of python.” these include:“readability countssimple is better than complexthere should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it”in case you were wondering, the zen of python is available in catchy musical

       "'python  programming language from wikipedia  the free encyclopediapython is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language  its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation  its language constructs as well as its object oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear  logical code for small and large scale projects  30 python is dynamically typed and garbage collected  it supports multiple programming paradigms  including structured  particularly  procedural   object oriented and functional programming  it is often described as a  batteries included  language due to its comprehensive standard library  31 guido van rossum began working on python in the late 1980s  as a successor to the abc programming language  and first released it in 1991 as python 0 9 0  32  python 2 0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features  such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting  python 3 0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible  python 2 was discontinued with version 2 7 18 in 2020  33 python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages  34  35  36  37 historypython was conceived in the late 1980s 38  by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde   informatica  cwi  in the netherlands as a successor to abc programming language  which was inspired by setl  39  capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system  10  its implementation began in december 1989  40  van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project  as the lead developer  until 12 july 2018  when he announced his  permanent vacation  from his responsibilities as python s  benevolent dictator for life   a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project s chief decision maker  41  in january 2019  active python core developers elected a five member  steering council  to lead the project  42  43 python 2 0 was released on 16 october 2000  with many major new features  including a cycle detecting garbage collector and support for unicode  44 python 3 0 was released on 3 december 2008  it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible  45  many of its major features were backported to python 2 6 x 46  and 2 7 x version series  releases of python 3 include the 2to3 utility  which automates the translation of python 2 code to python 3  47 python 2 7 s end of life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to python 3  48  49  no more security patches or other improvements will be released for it  50  51  with python 2 s end of life  only python 3 6 x 52  and later are supported python 3 9 2 and 3 8 8 were expedited 53  as all versions of python  including 2 7 54   had security issues  leading to possible remote code execution 55  and web cache poisoning  56 design philosophy and featurespython is a multi paradigm programming language  object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported  and many of its features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming  including by metaprogramming 57  and metaobjects  magic methods    58  many other paradigms are supported via extensions  including design by contract 59  60  and logic programming  61 python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management  62  it also features dynamic name resolution  late binding   which binds method and variable names during program execution python s design offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition  it has filter mapandreduce functions  list comprehensions  dictionaries  sets  and generator expressions  63  the standard library has two modules  itertools and functools  that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml  64 the language s core philosophy is summarized in the document the zen of python  pep 20   which includes aphorisms such as  65 beautiful is better than ugly explicit is better than implicit simple is better than complex complex is better than complicated readability counts rather than having all of its functionality built into its core  python was designed to be highly extensible  with modules   this compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications  van rossum s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with abc  which espoused the opposite approach  38  it is often described as a  batteries included  language due to its comprehensive standard library  66 python strives for a simpler  less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology  in contrast to perl s  there is more than one way to do it  motto  python embraces a  there should be one  and preferably only one  obvious way to do it  design philosophy  65  alex martelli  a fellow at the python software foundation and python book author  writes that  to describe something as  clever  is not considered a compliment in the python culture   67 python s developers strive to avoid premature optimization  and reject patches to non critical parts of the cpython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity  68  when speed is important  a python programmer can move time critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c  or use pypy  a just in time compiler  cython is also available  which translates a python script into c and makes direct c level api calls into the python interpreter python s developers aim for the language to be fun to use  this is reflected in its name a tribute to the british comedy group monty python 69  and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials  such as examples that refer to spam and eggs  a reference to a monty python sketch  instead of the standard foo and bar  70  71 a common neologism in the python community is pythonic  which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style  to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well  that it is natural or shows fluency in the language  that it conforms with python s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability  in contrast  code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic  72  73 users and admirers of python  especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced  are often referred to as pythonistas  74  75 syntax and semanticsmain article  python syntax and semanticspython is meant to be an easily readable language  its formatting is visually uncluttered  and it often uses english keywords where other languages use punctuation  unlike many other languages  it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks  and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely  if ever  used  it has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal  76 indentationmain article  python syntax and semantics   indentationpython uses whitespace indentation  rather than curly brackets or keywords  to delimit blocks  an increase in indentation comes after certain statements  a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block  77  thus  the program s visual structure accurately represents the program s semantic structure  78  this feature is sometimes termed the off side rule  which some other languages share  but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning  the recommended indent size is four spaces  79 statements and control flowpython s statements include  among others  the assignment statement  using a single equals sign   the if statement  which conditionally executes a block of code  along with else and elif  a contraction of else if  the for statement  which iterates over an iterable object  capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block the while statement  which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true the try statement  which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses  it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits the raise statement  used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception the class statement  which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class  for use in object oriented programming يبلميبةملنةيمبنلةيمنبةلمنيب يبل ينمبةل يمبنةل 0يب   يبلمويلكthe def statement  which defines a function or method the with statement  which encloses a code block within a context manager  for example  acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards  or opening a file and then closing it   allowing resource acquisition is initialization  raii  like behavior and replaces a common try finally idiom  80 the break statement  exits from a loop the continue statement  skips this iteration and continues with the next item the del statement  removes a variable  which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will cause an error  a deleted variable can be reassigned the pass statement  which serves as a nop  it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block the assert statement  used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply the yield statement  which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator  this form is used to implement coroutines the return statement  used to return a value from a function the import statement  which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program the assignment statement     operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate  dynamically allocated object  variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object  in python  a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it  however  at a given time  a variable will refer to some object  which will have a type  this is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically typed programming languages  where each variable may only contain values of a certain type python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations  and  according to guido van rossum  it never will  81  82  however  better support for coroutine like functionality is provided  by extending python s generators  83  before 2 5  generators were lazy iterators  information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator  from python 2 5  it is possible to pass information back into a generator function  and from python 3 3  the information can be passed through multiple stack levels  84 expressionssome python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as c and java  while some are not addition  subtraction  and multiplication are the same  but the behavior of division differs  there are two types of divisions in python  they are floor division  or integer division     and floating point division  85  python also uses the    operator for exponentiation from python 3 5  the new  infix operator was introduced  it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication  86  87 from python 3 8  the syntax     called the  walrus operator  was introduced  it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression  88 in python     compares by value  versus java  which compares numerics by value 89  and objects by reference  90   value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals   method   python s is operator may be used to compare object identities  comparison by reference   in python  comparisons may be chained  for example a    b    c python uses the words and  or  not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic           used in java and c python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression  63 anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions  however  these are limited in that the body can only be one expression conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y 91   different in order of operands from the c   x   y operator common to many other languages  python makes a distinction between lists and tuples  lists are written as  1  2  3   are mutable  and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries  dictionary keys must be immutable in python   tuples are written as  1  2  3   are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries  provided all elements of the tuple are immutable  the   operator can be used to concatenate two tuples  which does not directly modify their contents  but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples  thus  given the variable t initially equal to  1  2  3   executing t   t    4  5  first evaluates t    4  5   which yields  1  2  3  4  5   which is then assigned back to t  thereby effectively  modifying the contents  of t  while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects  parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts  92 python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions  each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to  a variable  a writable property  etc    are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and  as a whole  are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement  the statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it  assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left  93 python has a  string format  operator    this functions analogously to printf format strings in c  e g   spam  s eggs  d      blah   2  evaluates to  spam blah eggs 2   in python 3 and 2 6   this was supplemented by the format   method of the str class  e g   spam  0  eggs  1   format  blah   2   python 3 6 added  f strings   blah    blah   eggs   2  f spam  blah  eggs  eggs    94 strings in python can be concatenated  by  adding  them  same operator as for adding integers and floats   e g   spam     eggs  returns  spameggs   even if your strings contain numbers  they are still added as strings rather than integers  e g   2     2  returns  22  python has various kinds of string literals strings delimited by single or double quote marks  unlike in unix shells  perl and perl influenced languages  single quote marks and double quote marks function identically  both kinds of string use the backslash     as an escape character  string interpolation became available in python 3 6 as  formatted string literals   94 triple quoted strings  which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks  they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells  perl and ruby raw string varieties  denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r  escape sequences are not interpreted  hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common  such as regular expressions and windows style paths  compare   quoting  in c  python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists  denoted as a key   a start stop  or a start stop step   indexes are zero based  and negative indexes are relative to the end  slices take elements from the start index up to  but not including  the stop index  the third slice parameter  called step or stride  allows elements to be skipped and reversed  slice indexes may be omitted  for example a    returns a copy of the entire list  each element of a slice is a shallow copy in python  a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced  in contrast to languages such as common lisp  scheme  or ruby  this leads to duplicating some functionality  for example list comprehensions vs  for loopsconditional expressions vs  if blocksthe eval   vs  exec   built in functions  in python 2  exec is a statement   the former is for expressions  the latter is for statements statements cannot be a part of an expression  so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions  all being expressions  cannot contain statements  a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a   1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement  this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator   for an equality operator    in conditions  if  c   1          is syntactically valid  but probably unintended  c code but if c   1      causes a syntax error in python methodsmethods on objects are functions attached to the object s class  the syntax instance method argument  is  for normal methods and functions  syntactic sugar for class method instance  argument   python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data  in contrast to the implicit self  or this  in some other object oriented programming languages  e g   c    java  objective c  or ruby   95  apart from this  python also provides methods  often called dunder methods  due to their names beginning and ending with double underscores   to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length  comparison  in arithmetic operations  type conversion  and many more  96 typingpython uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names  type constraints are not checked at compile time  rather  operations on an object may fail  signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type  despite being dynamically typed  python is strongly typed  forbidding operations that are not well defined  for example  adding a number to a string  rather than silently attempting to make sense of them python allows programmers to define their own types using classes  which are most often used for object oriented programming  new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class  for example  spamclass   or eggsclass     and the classes are instances of the metaclass type  itself an instance of itself   allowing metaprogramming and reflection before version 3 0  python had two kinds of classes  old style and new style  97  the syntax of both styles is the same  the difference being whether the class object is inherited from  directly or indirectly  all new style classes inherit from object and are instances of type   in versions of python 2 from python 2 2 onwards  both kinds of classes can be used  old style classes were eliminated in python 3 0 the long term plan is to support gradual typing 98  and from python 3 5  the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation  cpython  an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile time type checking  99 arithmetic operationspython has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators               the floor division operator    and the modulo operation    where the remainder can be negative  e g  4    3     2   it also has    for exponentiation  e g  5  3    125 and 9  0 5    3 0  and a matrix multiplication operator    103  these operators work like in traditional math  with the same precedence rules  the operators infix    and   can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively  the division between integers produces floating point results  the behavior of division has changed significantly over time  104 current python  i e  since 3 0  changed   to always be floating point division  e g  5 2    2 5 python 2 2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity  e g  7 3    2 and  7 3     3  the floor division    operator was introduced  so 7  3    2   7  3     3  7 5  3    2 0 and  7 5  3     3 0  adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use python 3 0 rules for division  see next  python 2 1 and earlier used c s division behavior  the   operator is integer division if both operands are integers  and floating point division otherwise  integer division rounds towards 0  e g  7 3    2 and  7 3     2 in python terms    is true division  or simply division   and    is floor division    before version 3 0 is classic division  104 rounding towards negative infinity  though different from most languages  adds consistency  for instance  it means that the equation  a   b   b    a  b   1 is always true  it also means that the equation b  a  b    a b    a is valid for both positive and negative values of a  however  maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is  as expected  in the half open interval  0  b   where b is a positive integer  it has to lie in the interval  b  0  when b is negative  105 python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer  for tie breaking  python 3 uses round to even  round 1 5  and round 2 5  both produce 2  106  versions before 3 used round away from zero  round 0 5  is 1 0  round  0 5  is  1 0  107 python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics  for example  the expression a   b   c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c  108  c derived languages interpret this expression differently  in c  the expression would first evaluate a   b  resulting in 0 or 1  and that result would then be compared with c  109 python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations  the decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes  110  the fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers  111 due to python s extensive mathematics library  and the third party library numpy that further extends the native capabilities  it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation  112  113 programming exampleshello world program print  hello  world   program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer n   int input  type a number  and its factorial will be printed     if n   0     raise valueerror  you must enter a non negative integer  factorial   1for i in range 2  n   1      factorial    iprint factorial librariespython s large standard library  commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths  114  provides tools suited to many tasks  for internet facing applications  many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported  it includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces  connecting to relational databases  generating pseudorandom numbers  arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals  115  manipulating regular expressions  and unit testing some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications  for example  the web server gateway interface  wsgi  implementation wsgiref follows pep 333 116    but most modules are not  they are specified by their code  internal documentation  and test suites  however  because most of the standard library is cross platform python code  only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations as of september 2021  the python package index  pypi   the official repository

python moved to github in january 2017  155 cpython s public releases come in three types  distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented backward incompatible versions  where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported  the first part of the version number is incremented  these releases happen infrequently version 3 0 was released 8 years after 2 0 major or  feature  releases  occurred about every 18 months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with python 3 9 are expected to happen once a year  156  157  they are largely compatible but introduce new features  the second part of the version number is incremented  each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release  158 bugfix releases  159  which introduce no new features  occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release  security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases  the third and final part of the version number is incremented  159 many alpha  beta  and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases  although there is a rough schedule for each release  they are often delayed if the code is not ready  python s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during

python  whom python creator guido van rossum enjoyed while developing the language  monty python references appear frequently in python code and culture  165  for example  the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar  165  166  the official python documentation also contains various references to monty python routines  167  168 the prefix py  is used to show that something is related to python  examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame  a binding of sdl to python  commonly used to create games   pyqt and pygtk  which bind qt and gtk to python respectively  and pypy  a python implementation originally written in python popularitysince 2003  python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the tiobe programming community index where  as of february 2021  it is the third most popular language  behind java  and c   169  it was selected programming language of the year  for  the highest rise in ratings in a year   in 2007  2010  2018  and 2020  the only language to do so four times 170    171 an empirical study found that scripting languages  such as python  are more productive than conventional languages  such as c and java  for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary  and determined that memory consumption was often  better than java and not much worse than c or c     172 large organizations that use python include wikipedia  google  173  yahoo   174  cern  175  nasa  176  facebook  177  amazon  instagram  178  spotify 179  and some smaller entities like ilm 180  and ita  181  the social news networking site reddit was written mostly in python  182 _________________________________________stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow bloghere s a collection of resources on how to get started using python getting started with  pythonin this series  we look at the most loved languages according to the stack overflow developer survey  examine the spread and use cases for each of them  and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language  up now   3 on our list  python python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our developer survey  in 2020  66 7  of respondents said they want to keep working with python  conceived in the late 80s  it s one of the older languages on our list  coming just below newcomers rust  2010  and typescript  2012  evidence that original designer guido van rossum got a lot right python s quirky name in honor of the cult comedy show  monty python belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language  while it s not primarily used for performance intensive programming  it s often highly efficient to write  and programs tend to be clear and readable  this makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development  and it s used in a wide range of fields  from healthcare and finance to vfx and ai some  regard it as an ideal language for beginners  many terms are expressed using english words rather than symbols  its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent  and code written in python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages history of usetrending tags on stackoverflow comalthough python has been around since the 1 0 release in 1991  its usage has ballooned in recent years  indeed  as our former data scientist david robinson noted  since 2012  it has risen above the five other major languages  c    php  java  javascript and c   in usage as estimated by the number of stack overflow question views per month  tiobe s 2021 index ranks python as third in popularity at 10 86   rapidly gaining on c and java  16 34  and 11 29  respectively   today  44   of developers and technologists around the world are using python  until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person dutch computer scientist guido van rossum  who stepped down as python s  benevolent dictator for life  in 2018 but has remained an active contributor to this day who is using it python is more or less ubiquitous it would be faster to list industries that don t use it in some form  while it s not the language of choice for consumer applications like 3d games or mobile apps  even companies developing these applications frequently use python for tools and utilities  it is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes for example  in the vfx field  nearly all of the major software packages  maya  3ds max  houdini  cinema 4d  blender  and nuke  have embedded python interpreters  allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks  it s used more or less everywhere on earth and  well  even on mars in fact  if you re reading this on a mac  you already have python installed on your computer just go to terminal  type  python   and away you go who is it for studentsthe use of short english keywords instead of symbols makes python particularly friendly for beginners  see the example below additionally  python handles a lot of memory management automatically  so you ll spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like c   it comes bundled with a free ide  integrated development environment   idle  so you can get started quickly  in case you re wondering  yes  idle is a reference to monty python s eric idle if you use python you re going to be bombarded with references to vintage british comedy developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speedwhile python typically runs slower than other common languages like c   or java  it s often much quicker to write indeed  some estimates suggest a typical program in python is three to five times shorter than its java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the c   version this is one of the reasons it s often used as a  support language  software developers rely on it for tasks like build control  automated testing  and bug tracking  for the same reason  it s also used for prototyping code can be  hacked together  quickly to test ideas  before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language developers working with text or numberspython s powerful string and list manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers  and it s a great tool for exploring data  the fact that it doesn t need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program  and  by running python interactively  you can intuitively manipulate data step by step  examining it at each stage python s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of  packages   many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities  as well as fintech and engineering  these include the venerable numpy  mathematical functions and data analysis   scipy  for science   matplotlib  data visualization  and pandas  data analysis   and more recently tensorflow and keras  machine learning ai   as well as tens of thousands of others web developersanother key area of python use is backend development  it has built in support for common protocols like html  xml  and json  and frameworks like django  flask  and bottle are used widely for example  reddit s backend is python  python powers advanced content management  email automation  and more why you shouldn t learn itthere s a lot to like about python  but it s not always the perfect tool for the job perhaps most importantly  python is an interpreted language  as opposed to a compiled language like c    while that means there s no sitting around waiting for your code to compile  it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs  inherently limiting performance  so you re probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster 60fps first person shooter in python  but it s perfect for situations like data manipulation where you re likely to spend more time writing the program than running it additionally  python s somewhat unusual syntax means that if it s your first language not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages  although many of the underlying concepts are identical  for example  the reduced reliance on brackets and braces  the use of english words instead of symbols  and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in java or c   however  these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits  as evidenced by its ubiquity key conceptsthe core philosophies are summarized

       "'python  programming language from wikipedia  the free encyclopediapython is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language  its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation  its language constructs as well as its object oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear  logical code for small and large scale projects   python is dynamically typed and garbage collected  it supports multiple programming paradigms  including structured  particularly  procedural   object oriented and functional programming  it is often described as a  batteries included  language due to its comprehensive standard library   guido van rossum began working on python in the late s  as a successor to the abc programming language  and first released it in  as python       python   was released in  and introduced new features  such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting  python   was released in  and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible  python  was discontinued with version    in    python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages         historypython was conceived in the late s   by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde   informatica  cwi  in the netherlands as a successor to abc programming language  which was inspired by setl    capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system    its implementation began in december     van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project  as the lead developer  until  july   when he announced his  permanent vacation  from his responsibilities as python s  benevolent dictator for life   a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project s chief decision maker    in january   active python core developers elected a five member  steering council  to lead the project     python   was released on  october   with many major new features  including a cycle detecting garbage collector and support for unicode   python   was released on  december   it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible    many of its major features were backported to python   x   and   x version series  releases of python  include the to utility  which automates the translation of python  code to python    python   s end of life date was initially set at  then postponed to  out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to python       no more security patches or other improvements will be released for it      with python  s end of life  only python   x   and later are supported python    and    were expedited   as all versions of python  including      had security issues  leading to possible remote code execution   and web cache poisoning   design philosophy and featurespython is a multi paradigm programming language  object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported  and many of its features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming  including by metaprogramming   and metaobjects  magic methods      many other paradigms are supported via extensions  including design by contract     and logic programming   python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management    it also features dynamic name resolution  late binding   which binds method and variable names during program execution python s design offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition  it has filter mapandreduce functions  list comprehensions  dictionaries  sets  and generator expressions    the standard library has two modules  itertools and functools  that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml   the language s core philosophy is summarized in the document the zen of python  pep    which includes aphorisms such as   beautiful is better than ugly explicit is better than implicit simple is better than complex complex is better than complicated readability counts rather than having all of its functionality built into its core  python was designed to be highly extensible  with modules   this compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications  van rossum s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with abc  which espoused the opposite approach    it is often described as a  batteries included  language due to its comprehensive standard library   python strives for a simpler  less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology  in contrast to perl s  there is more than one way to do it  motto  python embraces a  there should be one  and preferably only one  obvious way to do it  design philosophy    alex martelli  a fellow at the python software foundation and python book author  writes that  to describe something as  clever  is not considered a compliment in the python culture    python s developers strive to avoid premature optimization  and reject patches to non critical parts of the cpython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity    when speed is important  a python programmer can move time critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c  or use pypy  a just in time compiler  cython is also available  which translates a python script into c and makes direct c level api calls into the python interpreter python s developers aim for the language to be fun to use  this is reflected in its name a tribute to the british comedy group monty python   and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials  such as examples that refer to spam and eggs  a reference to a monty python sketch  instead of the standard foo and bar     a common neologism in the python community is pythonic  which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style  to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well  that it is natural or shows fluency in the language  that it conforms with python s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability  in contrast  code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic     users and admirers of python  especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced  are often referred to as pythonistas     syntax and semanticsmain article  python syntax and semanticspython is meant to be an easily readable language  its formatting is visually uncluttered  and it often uses english keywords where other languages use punctuation  unlike many other languages  it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks  and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely  if ever  used  it has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal   indentationmain article  python syntax and semantics   indentationpython uses whitespace indentation  rather than curly brackets or keywords  to delimit blocks  an increase in indentation comes after certain statements  a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block    thus  the program s visual structure accurately represents the program s semantic structure    this feature is sometimes termed the off side rule  which some other languages share  but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning  the recommended indent size is four spaces   statements and control flowpython s statements include  among others  the assignment statement  using a single equals sign   the if statement  which conditionally executes a block of code  along with else and elif  a contraction of else if  the for statement  which iterates over an iterable object  capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block the while statement  which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true the try statement  which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses  it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits the raise statement  used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception the class statement  which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class  for use in object oriented programming يبلميبةملنةيمبنلةيمنبةلمنيب يبل ينمبةل يمبنةل يب   يبلمويلكthe def statement  which defines a function or method the with statement  which encloses a code block within a context manager  for example  acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards  or opening a file and then closing it   allowing resource acquisition is initialization  raii  like behavior and replaces a common try finally idiom   the break statement  exits from a loop the continue statement  skips this iteration and continues with the next item the del statement  removes a variable  which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will cause an error  a deleted variable can be reassigned the pass statement  which serves as a nop  it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block the assert statement  used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply the yield statement  which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator  this form is used to implement coroutines the return statement  used to return a value from a function the import statement  which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program the assignment statement     operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate  dynamically allocated object  variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object  in python  a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it  however  at a given time  a variable will refer to some object  which will have a type  this is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically typed programming languages  where each variable may only contain values of a certain type python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations  and  according to guido van rossum  it never will      however  better support for coroutine like functionality is provided  by extending python s generators    before    generators were lazy iterators  information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator  from python    it is possible to pass information back into a generator function  and from python    the information can be passed through multiple stack levels   expressionssome python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as c and java  while some are not addition  subtraction  and multiplication are the same  but the behavior of division differs  there are two types of divisions in python  they are floor division  or integer division     and floating point division    python also uses the    operator for exponentiation from python    the new  infix operator was introduced  it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication     from python    the syntax     called the  walrus operator  was introduced  it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression   in python     compares by value  versus java  which compares numerics by value   and objects by reference     value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals   method   python s is operator may be used to compare object identities  comparison by reference   in python  comparisons may be chained  for example a    b    c python uses the words and  or  not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic           used in java and c python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression   anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions  however  these are limited in that the body can only be one expression conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y    different in order of operands from the c   x   y operator common to many other languages  python makes a distinction between lists and tuples  lists are written as         are mutable  and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries  dictionary keys must be immutable in python   tuples are written as         are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries  provided all elements of the tuple are immutable  the   operator can be used to concatenate two tuples  which does not directly modify their contents  but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples  thus  given the variable t initially equal to         executing t   t        first evaluates t         which yields             which is then assigned back to t  thereby effectively  modifying the contents  of t  while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects  parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts   python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions  each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to  a variable  a writable property  etc    are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and  as a whole  are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement  the statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it  assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left   python has a  string format  operator    this functions analogously to printf format strings in c  e g   spam  s eggs  d      blah     evaluates to  spam blah eggs    in python  and     this was supplemented by the format   method of the str class  e g   spam    eggs     format  blah      python   added  f strings   blah    blah   eggs     f spam  blah  eggs  eggs     strings in python can be concatenated  by  adding  them  same operator as for adding integers and floats   e g   spam     eggs  returns  spameggs   even if your strings contain numbers  they are still added as strings rather than integers  e g          returns    python has various kinds of string literals strings delimited by single or double quote marks  unlike in unix shells  perl and perl influenced languages  single quote marks and double quote marks function identically  both kinds of string use the backslash     as an escape character  string interpolation became available in python   as  formatted string literals    triple quoted strings  which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks  they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells  perl and ruby raw string varieties  denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r  escape sequences are not interpreted  hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common  such as regular expressions and windows style paths  compare   quoting  in c  python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists  denoted as a key   a start stop  or a start stop step   indexes are zero based  and negative indexes are relative to the end  slices take elements from the start index up to  but not including  the stop index  the third slice parameter  called step or stride  allows elements to be skipped and reversed  slice indexes may be omitted  for example a    returns a copy of the entire list  each element of a slice is a shallow copy in python  a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced  in contrast to languages such as common lisp  scheme  or ruby  this leads to duplicating some functionality  for example list comprehensions vs  for loopsconditional expressions vs  if blocksthe eval   vs  exec   built in functions  in python   exec is a statement   the former is for expressions  the latter is for statements statements cannot be a part of an expression  so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions  all being expressions  cannot contain statements  a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a    cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement  this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator   for an equality operator    in conditions  if  c             is syntactically valid  but probably unintended  c code but if c         causes a syntax error in python methodsmethods on objects are functions attached to the object s class  the syntax instance method argument  is  for normal methods and functions  syntactic sugar for class method instance  argument   python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data  in contrast to the implicit self  or this  in some other object oriented programming languages  e g   c    java  objective c  or ruby     apart from this  python also provides methods  often called dunder methods  due to their names beginning and ending with double underscores   to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length  comparison  in arithmetic operations  type conversion  and many more   typingpython uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names  type constraints are not checked at compile time  rather  operations on an object may fail  signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type  despite being dynamically typed  python is strongly typed  forbidding operations that are not well defined  for example  adding a number to a string  rather than silently attempting to make sense of them python allows programmers to define their own types using classes  which are most often used for object oriented programming  new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class  for example  spamclass   or eggsclass     and the classes are instances of the metaclass type  itself an instance of itself   allowing metaprogramming and reflection before version    python had two kinds of classes  old style and new style    the syntax of both styles is the same  the difference being whether the class object is inherited from  directly or indirectly  all new style classes inherit from object and are instances of type   in versions of python  from python   onwards  both kinds of classes can be used  old style classes were eliminated in python   the long term plan is to support gradual typing   and from python    the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation  cpython  an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile time type checking   arithmetic operationspython has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators               the floor division operator    and the modulo operation    where the remainder can be negative  e g              it also has    for exponentiation  e g         and           and a matrix multiplication operator      these operators work like in traditional math  with the same precedence rules  the operators infix    and   can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively  the division between integers produces floating point results  the behavior of division has changed significantly over time   current python  i e  since    changed   to always be floating point division  e g         python   changed integer division to round towards negative infinity  e g        and          the floor division    operator was introduced  so                            and             adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use python   rules for division  see next  python   and earlier used c s division behavior  the   operator is integer division if both operands are integers  and floating point division otherwise  integer division rounds towards   e g        and         in python terms    is true division  or simply division   and    is floor division    before version   is classic division   rounding towards negative infinity  though different from most languages  adds consistency  for instance  it means that the equation  a   b   b    a  b    is always true  it also means that the equation b  a  b    a b    a is valid for both positive and negative values of a  however  maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is  as expected  in the half open interval    b   where b is a positive integer  it has to lie in the interval  b    when b is negative   python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer  for tie breaking  python  uses round to even  round    and round    both produce     versions before  used round away from zero  round    is    round     is      python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics  for example  the expression a   b   c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c    c derived languages interpret this expression differently  in c  the expression would first evaluate a   b  resulting in  or   and that result would then be compared with c   python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations  the decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes    the fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational

other programming languages is also benchmarked by the computer language benchmarks game   developmentpython s development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal  pep  process  the primary mechanism for proposing major new features  collecting community input on issues and documenting python design decisions    python coding style is covered in pep     outstanding peps are reviewed and commented on by the python community and the steering council   enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the cpython reference implementation  the mailing list python dev is the primary forum for the language s development  specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs python org    development originally took place on a self hosted source code repository running mercurial  until python moved to github in january    cpython s public releases come in three types  distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented backward incompatible versions  where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported  the first part of the version number is incremented  these releases happen infrequently version   was released  years after   major or  feature  releases  occurred about every  months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with python   are expected to happen once a year      they are largely compatible but introduce new features  the second part of the version number is incremented  each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release   bugfix releases    which introduce no new features  occur about every  months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release  security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases  the third and final part of the version number is incremented   many alpha  beta  and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases  although there is a rough schedule for each release  they are often delayed if the code is not ready  python s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development   the major academic conference on python is pycon  there are also special python mentoring programmes  such as pyladies python   deprecates wstr  to be removed in python    meaning python extensions   need to be modified by then     and also plans to add pattern matching to the language   api documentation generatorstools that can generate documentation for python api include pydoc  available as part of standard library   sphinx  pdoc and its forks  doxygen and graphviz  among others   namingpython s name is derived from the british comedy group monty python  whom python creator guido van rossum enjoyed while developing the language  monty python references appear frequently in python code and culture    for example  the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar      the official python documentation also contains various references to monty python routines     the prefix py  is used to show that something is related to python  examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame  a binding of sdl to python  commonly used to create games   pyqt and pygtk  which bind qt and gtk to python respectively  and pypy  a python implementation originally written in python popularitysince   python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the tiobe programming community index where  as of february   it is the third most popular language  behind java  and c     it was selected programming language of the year  for  the highest rise in ratings in a year   in       and   the only language to do so four times      an empirical study found that scripting languages  such as python  are more productive than conventional languages  such as c and java  for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary  and determined that memory consumption was often  better than java and not much worse than c or c      large organizations that use python include wikipedia  google    yahoo     cern    nasa    facebook    amazon  instagram    spotify   and some smaller entities like ilm

of resources on how to get started using python getting started with  pythonin this series  we look at the most loved languages according to the stack overflow developer survey  examine the spread and use cases for each of them  and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language  up now    on our list  python python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our developer survey  in      of respondents said they want to keep working with python  conceived in the late s  it s one of the older languages on our list  coming just below newcomers rust    and typescript    evidence that original designer guido van rossum got a lot right python s quirky name in honor of the cult comedy show  monty python belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language  while it s not primarily used for performance intensive programming  it s often highly efficient to write  and programs tend to be clear and readable  this makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development  and it s used in a wide range of fields  from healthcare and finance to vfx and ai some  regard it as an ideal language for beginners  many terms are expressed using english words rather than symbols  its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent  and code written in python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages history of usetrending tags on stackoverflow comalthough python has been around since the   release in   its usage has ballooned in recent years  indeed  as our former data scientist david robinson noted  since   it has risen above the five other major languages  c    php  java  javascript and c   in usage as estimated by the number of stack overflow question views per month  tiobe s  index ranks python as third in popularity at     rapidly gaining on c and java     and    respectively   today     of developers and technologists around the world are using python  until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person dutch computer scientist guido van rossum  who stepped down as python s  benevolent dictator for life  in  but has remained an active contributor to this day who is using it python is more or less ubiquitous it would be faster to list industries that don t use it in some form  while it s not the language of choice for consumer applications like d games or mobile apps  even companies developing these applications frequently use python for tools and utilities  it is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes for example  in the vfx field  nearly all of the major software packages  maya  ds max  houdini  cinema d  blender  and nuke  have embedded python interpreters  allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks  it s used more or less everywhere on earth and  well  even on mars in fact  if you re reading this on a mac  you already have python installed on your computer just go to terminal  type  python   and away you go who is it for studentsthe use of short english keywords instead of symbols makes python particularly friendly for beginners  see the example below additionally  python handles a lot of memory management automatically  so you ll spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like c   it comes bundled with a free ide  integrated development environment   idle  so you can get started quickly  in case you re wondering  yes  idle is a reference to monty python s eric idle if you use python you re going to be bombarded with references to vintage british comedy developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speedwhile python typically runs slower than other common languages like c   or java  it s often much quicker to write indeed  some estimates suggest a typical program in python is three to five times shorter than its java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the c   version this is one of the reasons it s often used as a  support language  software developers rely on it for tasks like build control  automated testing  and bug tracking  for the same reason  it s also used for prototyping code can be  hacked together  quickly to test ideas  before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language developers working with text or numberspython s powerful string and list manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers  and it s a great tool for exploring data  the fact that it doesn t need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program  and  by running python interactively  you can intuitively manipulate data step by step  examining it at each stage python s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of  packages   many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities  as well as fintech and engineering  these include the venerable numpy  mathematical functions and data analysis   scipy  for science   matplotlib  data visualization  and pandas  data analysis   and more recently tensorflow and keras  machine learning ai   as well as tens of thousands of others web developersanother key area of python use is backend development  it has built in support for common protocols like html  xml  and json  and frameworks like django  flask  and bottle are used widely for example  reddit s backend is python  python powers advanced content management  email automation  and more why you shouldn t learn itthere s a lot to like about python  but it s not always the perfect tool for the job perhaps most importantly  python is an interpreted language  as opposed to a compiled language like c    while that means there s no sitting around waiting for your code to compile  it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs  inherently limiting performance  so you re probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster fps first person shooter in python  but it s perfect for situations like data manipulation where you re likely to spend more time writing the program than running it additionally  python s somewhat unusual syntax means that if it s your first language not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages  although many of the underlying concepts are identical  for example  the reduced reliance on brackets and braces  the use of english words instead of symbols  and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in java or c   however  these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits  as evidenced by its ubiquity key conceptsthe core philosophies are summarized in

       "'python programming language from wikipedia the free encyclopediapython is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation its language constructs as well as its object oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear logical code for small and large scale projects python is dynamically typed and garbage collected it supports multiple programming paradigms including structured particularly procedural object oriented and functional programming it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library guido van rossum began working on python in the late s as a successor to the abc programming language and first released it in as python python was released in and introduced new features such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting python was released in and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible python was discontinued with version in python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages historypython was conceived in the late s by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde informatica cwi in the netherlands as a successor to abc programming language which was inspired by setl capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system its implementation began in december van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project as the lead developer until july when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as python s benevolent dictator for life a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project s chief decision maker in january active python core developers elected a five member steering council to lead the project python was released on october with many major new features including a cycle detecting garbage collector and support for unicode python was released on december it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible many of its major features were backported to python x and x version series releases of python include the to utility which automates the translation of python code to python python s end of life date was initially set at then postponed to out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to python no more security patches or other improvements will be released for it with python s end of life only python x and later are supported python and were expedited as all versions of python including had security issues leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning design philosophy and featurespython is a multi paradigm programming language object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported and many of its features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming including by metaprogramming and metaobjects magic methods many other paradigms are supported via extensions including design by contract and logic programming python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management it also features dynamic name resolution late binding which binds method and variable names during program execution python s design offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition it has filter mapandreduce functions list comprehensions dictionaries sets and generator expressions the standard library has two modules itertools and functools that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml the language s core philosophy is summarized in the document the zen of python pep which includes aphorisms such as beautiful is better than ugly explicit is better than implicit simple is better than complex complex is better than complicated readability counts rather than having all of its functionality built into its core python was designed to be highly extensible with modules this compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications van rossum s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with abc which espoused the opposite approach it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library python strives for a simpler less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology in contrast to perl s there is more than one way to do it motto python embraces a there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it design philosophy alex martelli a fellow at the python software foundation and python book author writes that to describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the python culture python s developers strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non critical parts of the cpython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity when speed is important a python programmer can move time critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c or use pypy a just in time compiler cython is also available which translates a python script into c and makes direct c level api calls into the python interpreter python s developers aim for the language to be fun to use this is reflected in its name a tribute to the british comedy group monty python and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials such as examples that refer to spam and eggs a reference to a monty python sketch instead of the standard foo and bar a common neologism in the python community is pythonic which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well that it is natural or shows fluency in the language that it conforms with python s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability in contrast code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic users and admirers of python especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced are often referred to as pythonistas syntax and semanticsmain article python syntax and semanticspython is meant to be an easily readable language its formatting is visually uncluttered and it often uses english keywords where other languages use punctuation unlike many other languages it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely if ever used it has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal indentationmain article python syntax and semantics indentationpython uses whitespace indentation rather than curly brackets or keywords to delimit blocks an increase in indentation comes after certain statements a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block thus the program s visual structure accurately represents the program s semantic structure this feature is sometimes termed the off side rule which some other languages share but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning the recommended indent size is four spaces statements and control flowpython s statements include among others the assignment statement using a single equals sign the if statement which conditionally executes a block of code along with else and elif a contraction of else if the for statement which iterates over an iterable object capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block the while statement which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true the try statement which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits the raise statement used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception the class statement which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class for use in object oriented programming the def statement which defines a function or method the with statement which encloses a code block within a context manager for example acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards or opening a file and then closing it allowing resource acquisition is initialization raii like behavior and replaces a common try finally idiom the break statement exits from a loop the continue statement skips this iteration and continues with the next item the del statement removes a variable which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will cause an error a deleted variable can be reassigned the pass statement which serves as a nop it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block the assert statement used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply the yield statement which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator this form is used to implement coroutines the return statement used to return a value from a function the import statement which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program the assignment statement operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate dynamically allocated object variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object in python a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it however at a given time a variable will refer to some object which will have a type this is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically typed programming languages where each variable may only contain values of a certain type python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations and according to guido van rossum it never will however better support for coroutine like functionality is provided by extending python s generators before generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator from python it is possible to pass information back into a generator function and from python the information can be passed through multiple stack levels expressionssome python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as c and java while some are not addition subtraction and multiplication are the same but the behavior of division differs there are two types of divisions in python they are floor division or integer division and floating point division python also uses the operator for exponentiation from python the new infix operator was introduced it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication from python the syntax called the walrus operator was introduced it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression in python compares by value versus java which compares numerics by value and objects by reference value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals method python s is operator may be used to compare object identities comparison by reference in python comparisons may be chained for example a b c python uses the words and or not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic used in java and c python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions however these are limited in that the body can only be one expression conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y different in order of operands from the c x y operator common to many other languages python makes a distinction between lists and tuples lists are written as are mutable and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in python tuples are written as are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries provided all elements of the tuple are immutable the operator can be used to concatenate two tuples which does not directly modify their contents but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples thus given the variable t initially equal to executing t t first evaluates t which yields which is then assigned back to t thereby effectively modifying the contents of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable a writable property etc are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and as a whole are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement the statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left python has a string format operator this functions analogously to printf format strings in c e g spam s eggs d blah evaluates to spam blah eggs in python and this was supplemented by the format method of the str class e g spam eggs format blah python added f strings blah blah eggs f spam blah eggs eggs strings in python can be concatenated by adding them same operator as for adding integers and floats e g spam eggs returns spameggs even if your strings contain numbers they are still added as strings rather than integers e g returns python has various kinds of string literals strings delimited by single or double quote marks unlike in unix shells perl and perl influenced languages single quote marks and double quote marks function identically both kinds of string use the backslash as an escape character string interpolation became available in python as formatted string literals triple quoted strings which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells perl and ruby raw string varieties denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common such as regular expressions and windows style paths compare quoting in c python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists denoted as a key a start stop or a start stop step indexes are zero based and negative indexes are relative to the end slices take elements from the start index up to but not including the stop index the third slice parameter called step or stride allows elements to be skipped and reversed slice indexes may be omitted for example a returns a copy of the entire list each element of a slice is a shallow copy in python a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced in contrast to languages such as common lisp scheme or ruby this leads to duplicating some functionality for example list comprehensions vs for loopsconditional expressions vs if blocksthe eval vs exec built in functions in python exec is a statement the former is for expressions the latter is for statements statements cannot be a part of an expression so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions all being expressions cannot contain statements a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator for an equality operator in conditions if c is syntactically valid but probably unintended c code but if c causes a syntax error in python methodsmethods on objects are functions attached to the object s class the syntax instance method argument is for normal methods and functions syntactic sugar for class method instance argument python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data in contrast to the implicit self or this in some other object oriented programming languages e g c java objective c or ruby apart from this python also provides methods often called dunder methods due to their names beginning and ending with double underscores to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length comparison in arithmetic operations type conversion and many more typingpython uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names type constraints are not checked at compile time rather operations on an object may fail signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type despite being dynamically typed python is strongly typed forbidding operations that are not well defined for example adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them python allows programmers to define their own types using classes which are most often used for object oriented programming new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example spamclass or eggsclass and the classes are instances of the metaclass type itself an instance of itself allowing metaprogramming and reflection before version python had two kinds of classes old style and new style the syntax of both styles is the same the difference being whether the class object is inherited from directly or indirectly all new style classes inherit from object and are instances of type in versions of python from python onwards both kinds of classes can be used old style classes were eliminated in python the long term plan is to support gradual typing and from python the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation cpython an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile time type checking arithmetic operationspython has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators the floor division operator and the modulo operation where the remainder can be negative e g it also has for exponentiation e g and and a matrix multiplication operator these operators work like in traditional math with the same precedence rules the operators infix and can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively the division between integers produces floating point results the behavior of division has changed significantly over time current python i e since changed to always be floating point division e g python changed integer division to round towards negative infinity e g and the floor division operator was introduced so and adding from future import division causes a module to use python rules for division see next python and earlier used c s division behavior the operator is integer division if both operands are integers and floating point division otherwise integer division rounds towards e g and in python terms is true division or simply division and is floor division before version is classic division rounding towards negative infinity though different from most languages adds consistency for instance it means that the equation a b b a b is always true it also means that the equation b a b a b a is valid for both positive and negative values of a however maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is as expected in the half open interval b where b is a positive integer it has to lie in the interval b when b is negative python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer for tie breaking python uses round to even round and round both produce versions before used round away from zero round is round is python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics for example the expression a b c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c c derived languages interpret this expression differently in c the expression would first evaluate a b resulting in or and that result would then be compared with c python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations the decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes the fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers due to python s extensive mathematics library and the third party library numpy that further extends the native capabilities it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation programming exampleshello world program print hello world program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer n int input type a number and its factorial will be printed if n raise valueerror you must enter a non negative integer factorial for i in range n factorial iprint factorial librariespython s large standard library commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths provides tools suited to many tasks for internet facing applications many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported it includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces connecting to relational databases generating pseudorandom numbers arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals manipulating regular expressions and unit testing some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example the web server gateway interface wsgi implementation wsgiref follows pep but most modules are not they are specified by their code internal documentation and test suites however because most of the standard library is cross platform python code only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations as of september the python package index pypi the official repository for third party python software contains over packages with a wide range of functionality including automationdata

processingweb frameworksweb scrapingdevelopment environmentssee also comparison of integrated development environments pythonmost python implementations including cpython include a read eval print loop repl permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately other shells including idle and ipython add

computing implementationssee also list of python software python implementationsreference implementationcpython is the reference implementation of python it is written in c meeting the c standard with several select c features with later c versions out it s considered outdated cpython includes its own c extensions but third party extensions are not limited to older c versions can e g be implemented with c or c it compiles python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine cpython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of c and native python it is available for many platforms including windows starting with python the python installer deliberately fails to install on windows and windows xp was supported until python and most modern unix like systems including macos and apple m macs since python with experimental installer and unofficial support for e g vms platform portability was one of its earliest priorities during the python and python time frame even os and solaris were supported support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms other implementationspypy is a fast compliant interpreter of python and its just in time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over cpython but several libraries written in c cannot be used with it stackless python is a significant fork of cpython that implements microthreads it does not use the call stack in the same way thus allowing massively concurrent programs pypy also has a stackless version micropython and circuitpython are python variants optimized for microcontrollers including lego mindstorms ev pyston is a variant of the python runtime that uses just in time compilation to speed up the execution of python programs cinder is a performance oriented fork of cpython that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching eager evaluation of coroutines a method at a time jit and an experimental bytecode compiler unsupported implementationsother just in time python compilers have been developed but are now unsupported google began a project named unladen swallow in with the aim of speeding up the python interpreter fivefold by using the llvm and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock psyco is a discontinued just in time specializing compiler that integrates with cpython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime the emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard python code psyco does not support python or later pys was a python interpreter for series mobile phones released by nokia in it implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the symbian operating system the nokia n also supports python with gtk widget libraries enabling programs to be written and run on the target device cross compilers to other languagesthere are several compilers to high level object languages with either unrestricted python a restricted subset of python or a language similar to python as the source language cython compiles a superset of python to c while the resulting code is also usable with python and also e g c nuitka compiles python into c pythran compiles a subset of python to c pyrex latest release in and shed skin latest release in compile to c and c respectively google s grumpy latest release in transpiles python to go ironpython now abandoned by microsoft allows running python programs on the net common language runtime jython compiles python to java bytecode allowing the use of the java libraries from a python program myhdl is a python based hardware description language hdl that converts myhdl code to verilog or vhdl code numba uses llvm to compile a subset of python to machine code brython transcrypt and pyjs latest release in compile python to javascript rpython can be compiled to c and is used to build the pypy interpreter of python performancea performance comparison of various python implementations on a non numerical combinatorial workload was presented at euroscipy python s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by the computer language benchmarks game developmentpython s development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal pep process the primary mechanism for proposing major new features collecting community input on issues and documenting python design decisions python coding style is covered in pep outstanding peps are reviewed and commented on by the python community and the steering council enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the cpython reference implementation the mailing list python dev is the primary forum for the language s development specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs python org development originally took place on a self hosted source code repository running mercurial until python moved to github in january cpython s public releases come in three types distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented backward incompatible versions where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported the first part of the version number is incremented these releases happen infrequently version was released years after major or feature releases occurred about every months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with python are expected to happen once a year they are largely compatible but introduce new features the second part of the version number is incremented each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release bugfix releases which introduce no new features occur about every months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases the third and final part of the version number is incremented many alpha beta and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases although there is a rough schedule for each release they are often delayed if the code is not ready python s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development the major academic conference on python is pycon there are also special python mentoring programmes such as pyladies python deprecates wstr to be removed in python meaning python extensions need to be modified by then and also plans to add pattern matching to the language api documentation generatorstools that can generate documentation for python api include pydoc available as part of standard library sphinx pdoc and its forks doxygen and graphviz among others namingpython s name is derived from the british comedy group monty python whom python creator guido van rossum enjoyed while developing the language monty python references appear frequently in python code and culture for example the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar the official python documentation also contains various references to monty python routines the prefix py is used to show that something is related to python examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame a binding of sdl to python commonly used to create games pyqt and pygtk which bind qt and gtk to python respectively and pypy a python implementation originally written in python popularitysince python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the tiobe programming community index where as of february it is the third most popular language behind java and c it was selected programming language of the year for the highest rise in ratings in a year in and the only language to do so four times an empirical study found that scripting languages such as python are more productive than conventional languages such as c and java for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary and determined that memory consumption was often better than java and not much worse than c or c large organizations that use python include wikipedia google yahoo cern nasa facebook amazon instagram spotify and some smaller entities like ilm and ita the social news networking site reddit was written mostly in python stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow bloghere s a collection of resources on how to get started using python getting started with pythonin this series we look at the most loved languages according to the stack overflow developer survey examine the spread and use cases for each of them and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language up now on our list python python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our developer survey in of respondents said they want to keep working with python conceived in the late s it s one of the older languages on our list coming just below newcomers rust and typescript evidence that original designer guido van rossum got a lot right python s quirky name in honor of the cult comedy show monty python belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language while it s not primarily used for performance intensive programming it s often highly efficient to write and programs tend to be clear and readable this makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development and it s used in a wide range of fields from healthcare and finance to vfx and ai some regard it as an ideal language for beginners many terms are expressed using english words rather than symbols its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent and code written in python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages history of usetrending tags on stackoverflow comalthough python has been around since the release in its usage has ballooned in recent years indeed as our former data scientist david robinson noted since it has risen above the five other major languages c php java javascript and c in usage as estimated by the number of stack overflow question views per month tiobe s index ranks python as third in popularity at rapidly gaining on c and java and respectively today of developers and technologists around the world are using python until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person dutch computer scientist guido van rossum who stepped down as python s benevolent dictator for life in but has remained an active contributor to this day who is using it python is more or less ubiquitous it would be faster to list industries that don t use it in some form while it s not the language of choice for consumer applications like d games or mobile apps even companies developing these applications frequently use python for tools and utilities it is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes for example in the vfx field nearly all of the major software packages maya ds max houdini cinema d blender and nuke have embedded python interpreters allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks it s used more or less everywhere on earth and well even on mars in fact if you re reading this on a mac you already have python installed on your computer just go to terminal type python and away you go who is it for studentsthe use of short english keywords instead of symbols makes python particularly friendly for beginners see the example below additionally python handles a lot of memory management automatically so you ll spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like c it comes bundled with a free ide integrated development environment idle so you can get started quickly in case you re wondering yes idle is a reference to monty python s eric idle if you use python you re going to be bombarded with references to vintage british comedy developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speedwhile python typically runs slower than other common languages like c or java it s often much quicker to write indeed some estimates suggest a typical program in python is three to five times shorter than its java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the c version this is one of the reasons it s often used as a support language software developers rely on it for tasks like build control automated testing and bug tracking for the same reason it s also used for prototyping code can be hacked together quickly to test ideas before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language developers working with text or numberspython s powerful string and list manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers and it s a great tool for exploring data the fact that it doesn t need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program and by running python interactively you can intuitively manipulate data step by step examining it at each stage python s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of packages many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities as well as fintech and engineering these include the venerable numpy mathematical functions and data analysis scipy for science matplotlib data visualization and pandas data analysis and more recently tensorflow and keras machine learning ai as well as tens of thousands of others web developersanother key area of python use is backend development it has built in support for common protocols like html xml and json and frameworks like django flask and bottle are used widely for example reddit s backend is python python powers advanced content management email automation and more why you shouldn t learn itthere s a lot to like about python but it s not always the perfect tool for the job perhaps most importantly python is an interpreted language as opposed to a compiled language like c while that means there s no sitting around waiting for your code to compile it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs inherently limiting performance so you re probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster fps first person shooter in python but it s perfect for situations like data manipulation where you re likely to spend more time writing the program than running it additionally python s somewhat unusual syntax means that if it s your first language not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages although many of the underlying concepts are identical for example the reduced reliance on brackets and braces the use of english words instead of symbols and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in java or c however these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits as evidenced by its ubiquity key conceptsthe core philosophies are summarized in pythonic fashion in the zen of python these include readability countssimple is better than complexthere should be one and preferably only one
